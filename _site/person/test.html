<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>By 2014, half of humanity has moved to cities, and the process of urbanization will grow even faster. By 2050, it is said, humanity will be 70% urbanized. Therefore, it is very important to study the form, growth and evolution of the city.</p>

<p>One of the research our groups focused on was the modeling of cities and the use of big data analysis to study cities.</p>

<h2 id="growth-model-of-cities-1">Growth Model of Cities</h2>

<p>One of the great fascinations of complexity research is that there may be a very simple rule behind the complex appearance. For a system as complex as the city, the complexity research in recent years has revealed the laws of ZIPF, Gibrat, and the law of heterospeed growth, etc. There are even a wide variety of quantitative models that can explain the shape and growth of cities.</p>

<p>Based on the previous research, we proposed our own growth model of cities. The model is based on the very simple assumption that human beings need to be connected to each other once they enter the city and settle down, so that people can easily share resources. Beyond that, we can create a model of urban growth for urban roads and for people to make simple rules for their socio economic interactions. The model can not only explain the various growth laws observed for a long time, but also give the shape of population, road and GDP in space quantitatively, and coincide with the empirical data. For more details about this model, see: <a href="http://wiki.swarma.net/index.php/%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D%E7%94%9F%E9%95%BF%E9%9A%8F%E6%9C%BA%E5%87%A0%E4%BD%95%E5%9B%BE%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B">matching the growth random geometry model.</a></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are enormous complexity in the socioeconomic systems, not only because of the existence of huge interactive elements in the system, but also because of the participation of people, expectations, incomplete information, and groups have exerted tremendous influence, making it a huge challenge to understand and make predictions in the system. This part of the study includes the formation of cities, the size of the company, the formation of prices in the auction, the choice of names, the laws of the Chinese language, international trade, population migration, the behavior of scientists and other aspects.</p>
